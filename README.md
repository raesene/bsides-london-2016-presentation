# B-Sides London 2016 Presentation

My slidedeck and notes for Presentation at [B-Sides London 2016](B-Sides London 2016).  Tech used is [Reveal.JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) and [Jekyll-Reveal](https://github.com/dploeger/jekyll-revealjs).

Markdown files for the presentation are in the [_posts](https://github.com/raesene/bsides-london-2016-presentation/tree/master/_posts) directory and render ok on github.

To run the presentation just install Ruby and jekyll, then run ```jekyll serve -H 127.0.0.1``` and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser of choice.
